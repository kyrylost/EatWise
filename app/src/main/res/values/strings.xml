    <string name="dialog_water_note">Note: when we talk about water, we talk about
        other liquids too. So, if you have drunk milk, or ate
        a tomato, you may also add it to consumed water.

        liquids were water

    <string name="dialog_protein_note">Note: when discussing protein,
        it\'s important to prioritize a diverse range of protein sources
        in your diet. Incorporating lean meats, fish, poultry, legumes, nuts,
        and dairy products can help ensure an adequate protein intake.
        By diversifying your protein sources, you can provide your body with a
        wider array of essential amino acids and nutrients for optimal health.

    <string name="dialog_carb_note">Note: carbohydrates are important for energy.
        Include a variety of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes for
        essential fiber and nutrients. Choose minimally processed carbs and avoid
        excessive refined sugars and grains.
    </string>

    <string name="dialog_fat_note">Note: healthy fats are important for overall health.
        Unsaturated fats, particularly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats,
        are considered better choices for overall health. These can be found in
        foods such as avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, fatty fish (like salmon and trout),
        and plant-based oils like canola and sunflower oil. Avoid excessive intake of saturated
        and trans fats found in processed foods.
    </string>

    <string name="dialog_fiber_note">Note: fiber is essential for a healthy diet.
        Choose whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts for fiber intake.

        Gradually increase fiber intake and stay hydrated for optimal results.
    </string>

    <string name="dialog_sugar_note">Note: sugar consumption should be moderated for
        overall health. Limit intake of added sugars found in processed foods, sugary
        beverages, and desserts. Instead, focus on natural sugars from fruits. Be mindful
        of hidden sugars in packaged foods and opt for healthier alternatives.
    </string>

    <string name="dialog_salt_note">Note: limit salt intake by reducing added salt and
        choosing fresh, whole foods. Processed foods are often high in sodium, so minimize
        their consumption for better salt regulation and overall health.
